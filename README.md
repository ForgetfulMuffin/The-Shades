    The-Shades is a project freely inspired by Zork, a great name in text based video games, and by the Shades district 
in the fictionnal city of Ankh-Morprk, from the Discworld universe by Sir Terry Pratchett.

    Items and creatures, as you will see, come from multiple sources ranging from classic games to more recent ones.

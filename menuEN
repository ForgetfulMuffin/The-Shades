                         To steal a piece of bread in Ankh-Morpork!
                     Well that was a dumb idea! now you have the watch
                     tailing you with the help of the thieves guild who 
                     don't like their work being stolen from them.
                     and on top of all that, you took the wrong turn and
                     noww find yourself in the Shades' district.
                     You must quicly find your way out of this giant
                     labyrinth so as not to risk your skin for too much
                     time.

                         You start at the North-West of the maze and 
                     must reach one of the exits East or South.
                     Time spent increases according to your actions.
                     Hyperactivity can lead you to your demise.
                     
                     PS : If ever misfortune was awaiting you in
                     the labyrinth, we would like to honour your 
                     memory. What is your name again?

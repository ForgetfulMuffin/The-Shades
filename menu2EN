                         Before venturing in the district and, eventually,
                     get out of it alive, you must specify the difficulty
                     you want to play in. It is defined by a integer between
                     6 and 100.
 
                         The map is a square which side is made of as many
                     areas as your difficulty level. For example, if you 
                     chose a difficulty level of 6, the map will be made of
                     36 explorable areas. You playthrough will be short and
                     the dangers you will encounter will be small.

                         However, if you chose a difficulty level of 100, 
                     there will be 10 000 explorable areas. This will make 
                     a very long playthrough and the challenge will be real.

                         What difficulty do you chose?
